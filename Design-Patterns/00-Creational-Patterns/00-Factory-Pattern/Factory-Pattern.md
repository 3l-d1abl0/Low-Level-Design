Define an Interface for creating an Object, but defer object instantiation to run time.



1. Interface/Abstract Class that defines the common functionality
2. Implement the specific Classes
3. Factory Class that instantiates the right implementation depending on what is required


Abstract Factory :

One more level of abstraction above Factory Pattern.

Abstract base class, however you can make them.
