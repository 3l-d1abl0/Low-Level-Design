Prototype Pattern:


Prototype Pattern in used where there are Complicated Objects.
And it is more easier to copy an existing Object than to fully initalize a new one from scratch
(reiterate the existing designs)

The idea is :
An existing (partially of fully constructed) design is a Prototype.

Make a copy(clone) the prototype and customize it. (Requires a Deep Copy)

We make the cloning convenient (e.g. via a Factory)
